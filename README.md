Welcome to SVG Artistry, the ultimate SVG Logo Maker! This innovative console line application, built using Node.js and the powerful Inquirer library, empowers freelance web developers like you to create stunning logos for your projects without the need to hire a graphic designer.

## Requirements

Before you embark on your logo creation journey, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/en)
- [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Jest

At SVG Artistry, we are committed to delivering a robust and error-free experience. That's why we have implemented thorough testing using [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest). Our code is carefully crafted to ensure smooth logo generation and reliability.

### ES6 Modules and Babel-Jest

Our project embraces the modern ES6 module system for imports and exports, providing a clean and organized codebase. As Jest is compatible with common JS imports and exports, we use [babel-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-jest) to handle the necessary import/export conversions. This ensures seamless integration between Jest and our ES6 modules.

For your convenience, we have included essential configuration files, 'jest.config.cjs,' and '.babelrc.'

## Unleash Your Creativity: User Story

Additionally, you can customize the shape's color to complement your design.
